Describe what you are trying to build, why do you want to build it, what it will be useful for, how it will be used, etc.

It is useful for practicing the process of game design/coding. 
How it will be used is dependant on the user.

(Important) Draw initial UML class diagram.

Around 3-4 hours per day for mistakes, problem solving, etc.

 Estimated amount of time: 20-30 hours
